Found bug in ignore functions that would sometimes mis-compare IP's (also

you setup to ignore either a tcp or a udp event an attacker could
activate the detector, cause the blocked file to be written to and
then activate the side you *wanted* the blocking to occur on and
have Sentry ignore them. A big thanks for finding this!
