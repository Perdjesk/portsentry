Known bugs in this beta:

- Port ranges cannot be defined.
- Signal handler is not ignoring signals
- Existing ports are not ignored on startup
- Only supports ethernet network type
- Does not determine local interface address automatically
- BPF filter dumps core on some platforms because filter list is too long 
sometimes. (OpenBSD)
- libpcap sees packets even after packet filter is working. This makes the "already blocked host...ignoring" message appear after host is blocked.
- Lots of warnings under BSD platforms during compile.
- Higher false alarm rates. SmartVerify option is not stopping all instances of bogus 
alarms.
